# Project-unit-1

Hello everyone 
- This repo for my first project in Tuwaiq academy whitch is an website that display the current weather of cities.

## Functionalities in the website:
- Add new city to see its weather info.
- Remove any city you don't want to see its weather info.
- Dark & Light mode.

## Tools used:
- Bootstrap: CSS framework for developing responsive website.
- Trello: Project management tool to orgnize the time and work.
- Figma: Wireframing thats help me to design my website befor jumpping into coding
- Current weather data API: an API that can access current weather data for any location on Earth including over 200,000 cities.

## Problem encountered:
- Choseing the API: It took me one day while search and try more than one API to get the appropriate API, and then I choice current weather data API because it is updated every time and it is live data, so I liked that.
- Find good design: In fact, I have no experience in designing interfaces, but I tried to make the user interface simple and easy to use, and figma helped me with that.
